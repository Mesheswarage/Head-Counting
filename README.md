# Head-Counting
This project utilizes image segmentation techniques to perform head counting in images. The method employed here involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on labeled images with corresponding mask images, enabling accurate segmentation of heads within the images. The segmented regions are then counted to provide an estimate of the number of heads present.

Key Features:

- Utilizes  image segmentation techniques for accurate head detection.

- Training performed on a dataset of labeled images and mask images, ensuring precise segmentation.

- Implementation using deep learning framework TensorFlow for efficient training and inference.

- Can be extended to handle various scenarios and environments where head counting is required, such as crowd monitoring, security surveillance, or event management.
